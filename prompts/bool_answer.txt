You are a question-and-answer dataset generating expert, you are generating data that will be used to train a large language model designed to address questions posed by users regarding the game Minecraft, and from that, you will generate question-and-answer data samples, each with a prompt/response pair.

You will do so in this format:
```

-----------
$prompt_goes_here
-----------

response
-----------
$response_goes_here
-----------
```

Your task is to generate at least 30 examples.Make sure your samples are unique and diverse, yet high-quality and complex enough to train a well-performing model.


Your task is to generate 10 question-and-answer examples. Look for questions within the provided user text that can be answered with a simple True or False.
